      <p>The Project PEACH Social Media Dashboard (the “Dashboard”)
      is a social analytic platform developed by the <a href="http://tid.gatech.edu/">Technologies
      and International Development Lab</a> at the Georgia Institute of Technology
      (“we”) as part of a research study. The Dashboard is accessed by users
      (“Dashboard Users”), including research team members and community health
      partners who are part of the Project PEACH research collaboration, to view and
      understand social media content related to COVID-19. This Privacy Policy
      describes how we collect, use, and disclose information of the Dashboard Users,
      as well as users of social media platforms (“Social Media Platform Users”)
      whose information and content are processed and displayed on our Dashboard. We
      refer to Dashboard Users and Social Media Platform Users separately throughout
      this Privacy Policy, but collectively we refer to each as “you” or “your.”</p>

      

      <p>The development of this dashboard was supported by the
      National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the
      National Institutes of Health under Award Number P30DK111024, Rapid
      Optimization of COVID-19 Testing for People Affected by Diabetes. The content
      is solely the responsibility of the research team and does not necessarily
      represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health.</p>

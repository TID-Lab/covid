        The Project PEACH Social Media Dashboard (the “Dashboard”) is a social
        analytic platform developed by the{' '}
        <a href="http://tid.gatech.edu/">
          Technologies and International Development Lab
        </a>{' '}
        at the Georgia Institute of Technology (“we”) as part of a research
        study. The Dashboard is accessed by users (“Dashboard Users”), including
        research team members and community health partners who are part of the
        Project PEACH research collaboration, to view and understand social
        media content related to COVID-19. This Privacy Policy describes how we
        collect, use, and disclose information of the Dashboard Users, as well
        as users of social media platforms (“Social Media Platform Users”) whose
        information and content are processed and displayed on our Dashboard. We
        refer to Dashboard Users and Social Media Platform Users separately
        throughout this Privacy Policy, but collectively we refer to each as
        “you” or “your.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The development of this dashboard was supported by the National
        Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National
        Institutes of Health under Award Number P30DK111024, Rapid Optimization
        of COVID-19 Testing for People Affected by Diabetes. The content is
        solely the responsibility of the research team and does not necessarily
        represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health.
